# Enable-classic-context-Menu-via-batch-file
To make Windows 11 always show the full classic context menu (i.e., “Show more options” by default when right-clicking), you can use a .bat file to modify the registry. Here's a batch script that adds the necessary registry key

What this does:
- Adds a registry key that disables the new Windows 11 context menu and restores the classic one.
- Automatically restarts windows explorer for you for changes to take effect.
